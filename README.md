# Memviz

`Memviz` is a Visual Studio code extension designed to visualize the address space (stack, heap, variables, etc.)
of C programs. Something like [Python tutor](https://pythontutor.com/), but directly in VSCode.

It is primarily designed to help students of the [Introduction to Programming](https://github.com/geordi/upr-course) course at VSB-TUO.

You can [**download**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jakub-beranek.memviz) the extension on VSCode Marketplace.

You can find more information about the extension [here](./extension/README.md).
